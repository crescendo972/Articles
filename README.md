# Articles
Hi, my name is Elena Litvikh and I am interested in finding a PHD student position in music theory. My main area of interest is 20-th century music, music aesthetics, connection between music and other arts and sciences. This repository is created to contain my articles. Original articles were written in Russian language, at the moment translations are done only by means of AI.
